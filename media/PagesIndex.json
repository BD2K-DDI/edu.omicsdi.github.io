the search can be sorted by three different categories Accession Relevance Publication Date The Accession is the accession of the datasets in the system the Relevance is how close is the dataset is two the specific query the Publication Date sort the datasets by publication date Relevance The actual search is done via a call to Apache Lucene which takes two arguments the query and an upper bound on the number of hits datasets to return Lucene scoring uses a combination of the Vector Space Model VSM of Information Retrieval and the Boolean model to determine how relevant a given Document is to a Users query In general the idea behind the VSM is the more times a query term appears in a document relative to the number of times the term appears in all the documents in the collection the more relevant that document is to the query It uses the Boolean model to first narrow down the documents that need to be scored based on the use of boolean logic in the Query specification Lucene also adds some capabilities and refinements onto this model to support boolean and fuzzy searching but it essentially remains a VSM based system at the heart "},{"title":"Navigation Omics from Home

Components","Keywords","Search","Auto-Complete"],"href":"content/post/searching-in-omicsdi","content":"The main goal of the Omics Discovery Indexwwwomicsdiorg is to provide a platform for searching and linking omics public data OmicsDI has implemented a unique and novel Search Engine for omics datasets including public and protected data The OmicsDI Search Box The OmicsDI Search Box is the main component to searching in OmicsDI The user can type a set of keywords that will enable the system to find the datasets containing those keywords If the user use double quote breast cancer in their search the system will try to find the exact sentence in the datasets The OmicsDI Search Box provides a unique autocomplete feature that enable user to select sentence after typing a subset of keywords For example Figure 2 shows all sentencesphrases in OmicsDI containing the words breast cancer Query Syntax When the user types any text in OmicsDI Search Box the input is translated into an Apache Lucene queryhttpluceneapacheorg that is then executed to get the search results The actual query executed is generated following the typical Apache Lucene query syntax in order to provide a generic approach avoiding complex query rearrangements Multiple search terms separated by white spaces are combined by default in AND logic Therefore an input text containing for example glutathione transferase is treated as glutathione AND transferase and only entries having both terms will be found The default order of results is based on their relevance ie the proximity of the terms in the entries In the Table 1 below an overview of some useful query syntax elements is presented Element Meaning Usage Example Notes AND In addition to term1 AND term2 glutathione AND transferase Matches entries where both glutathione and transferase occur OR Equivalence term1 OR term2 glutathione OR transferase Matches entries where either glutathione or transferase occur NOT Exclusion term1 NOT term2 coding NOT fragment Matches entries containing coding but not fragment Wildcard partialTerm gluta Matches for instance glutathione glutamate glutamic Exact match quoted text xray diffraction Exact matching for entries containing xray diffraction Grouping text reductase OR transferase AND glutathione Field Fieldspecific search fieldIdterm descriptiondopamine Matches for a field description containing dopamine Escaping special characters The following characters within queries require to be escaped using a before the character to escape in order to be correctly interpreted Since Apache Lucene supports regular expression searches matching a pattern between forward slashes the forward slash has become a special character to be escaped For example to search for cancertestis use the query cancertestis If special characters are not escaped the actual query performed may be different from what expected Query examples Following the aforementioned query syntax users can easily search and filter results according to data content and characteristics A few examples of queries that can be performed using EBI Search are listed below Search for insulin receptorhttpwwwomicsdiorgsearchqinsulin20receptor Search Datasets that identified P07900 Searching using Biological Evidences The OmicsDI Search Box allows the endusers to search data using biological evidences such as the list of the proteins identified in the proteomics experiment or the metabolite reported in the Metabolomics experiment For example Figure 3 if the user search for

OmicsDI stores metadata coming from the public datasets from every resource using an efficient indexing system which is able to integrate different biological entities including genes proteins and metabolites with the relevant life science literature OmicsDI is updated daily as new datasets get publicly available in the contributing repositories Omics Data Submission The increasing role of huge datasets in scientific research has important implications for the way the research is conducted for the way it should be organised and funded and for the training of new researchers However the advances in biomedical research depend on scientists ability to consult and use all available data independently from where they were originally produced data sharing on a global scale is the best way to advance science for the public good The assumption underlying this policy is that the more scientists are allowed to access the same sets of data the more those data will be used to produce new knowledge about biological phenomena Figure 1 shows how data is producedstore and distributed in biomedical research The result of an omics experiment eg Proteomics or Metabolomics is submitted to a public Archive eg PRIDE or Metaboligths These Data Archives provide a common interface for submission validation and downloading of the original resultsdata Importantly each individual repositoryarchive define three major components to guide the submission process The metadata guidelines including Standards and Ontologies to definedescribe a datasets and corresponding components eg samples instruments File formats to store and handle the underlying data in the Dataset The submission guidelines define how to submit and retrieve the data from the repository In recent years the number of databases and archives has growth in all omics fields 1 For example in Proteomics the results of a Mass spectrometry experiment can be submitted to four different databases members of ProteomeXchangewwwproteomexchangeorg PeptideAtlasPASSEL PRIDE MassIVE jPOST In addition each Omics field has developed and growth independently of the other fields including their metadata specifications file formats and submission guidelines For this reason most of the Data Archives are field specific eg Metabolomics Metaboligths Metabolomics Workbench Omics Data Dissemination After the data is submitted to a formal a hrefArchive Knowledge Base Databases BDs reuse part of the public data to respond specific questions eg Gene Expression Profiles ExpressionAtlas The number of these DBs has growth in recent years For example Table 1 shows the list of Protein Expression Databases 1 that include peptide sequences posttranslational modifications expression profiles Table 1
